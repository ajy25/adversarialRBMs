# Adversarially-trained Restricted Boltzmann Machines
This respository contains an implementation of a Gaussian-Bernoulli RBM described in the paper 
[Boltzmann Encoded Adversarial Machines](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.08682). We attempt to implement the BEAM and 
reproduce results from the paper. 

This repository was initially created by Andrew Yang and Jason Eveleth for the final project of CSCI 2952Q taught
by Professor Yu Cheng at Brown University.
